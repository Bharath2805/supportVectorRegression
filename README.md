 Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a machine learning algorithm that applies the principles of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to regression problems. Unlike traditional regression models that aim to minimize the error between predicted and actual values, SVR seeks to fit the best possible line within a specified margin of tolerance, called epsilon
